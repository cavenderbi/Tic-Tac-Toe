# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the wonderful world of tic-tac-toe. For this assignment, I coded a C++ implementation of the classic pen-and-paper game Tic-Tac-Toe. Given the simple implementation, a keyboard is required, but I'll go into that more in Materials. 

# Materials

You'll need a keyboard to play. An internet connection is also required to install, but not to play. Enjoy your Tic-Tac-Toe completely DRM free!

*This has only been tested on Ubuntu Linux. If you are trying on any other platform, that's uncharted territory and you may run into issues that I have not encountered.*

# Installation

This will be from the perspective of Linux OS (Pop! OS).

Firstly, navigate to the GitHub page. 

Click the `Code` button and select `Download ZIP`. 

Extract the folder. 

Open the new folder. It should be called Tic-Tac-Toe-main. Then open that folder in the Terminal. 

To run the game, type ./Tic-Tac-Toe. If this is your first time running the game, you may have to give it execute permissions. You'll know this is the case if you get a permission denied error. To do that, in the console type chmod 770. This will give the Tic-Tac-Toe executable permissions to be executed. 

Have fun!

Assuming the game has already been installed, all you need is a friend. 

The board has been split into X and Y coordinates ranging from 0 - 2. This is displayed which is which along the top and left of the board. Select a row and column and place your letter. Press enter to confirm your selection. 


# FAQ

*Do I need to understand code to get this to work on my system?*

No. No additional code or compilation is needed to get it to work. Currently it has only been tested on Linux, however.

*Why Linux?*

~~Why Windows?~~ Because I like Linux and dealing with the Windows terminal is a pain in my rear.

*I have a different question. Can I bug you about it?*

Yes. You can reach me at cavenderbi@appstate.edu
